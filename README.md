keccak-verilog
==============

A Verilog (specifically, System Verilog) implementation of the not-yet-finalized SHA-3 winner, Keccak. This is for a SystemVerilog class project. This design was validated with Questa and Veloce. I presented it as part of class on 6 June 2013 and the presentation is available at https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fEvkiKvQkEGiJ8LwQPkU6PK8SjZtGHqMSyf2X4v82iY/.
